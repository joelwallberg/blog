I am a PhD student in the Division of Medical Imaging in the Department of Physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. Prior to my doctoral studies, I studied mathematics in the joint MSc programme at Stockholm University and KTH. 

My main research interest lies at the intersection of deep learning and inverse problems in medical imaging. Please feel free to reach out!
